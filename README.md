# Jekyllstrap

A Bootstrap theme for Jekyll by Suffolk Libraries.

## Installation

Clone from github and `bundle install` dependencies. You may need to run `bundle update sass` to upgrade to v >3.5, which Bootstrap needs for some mixin code.

## Theming

Make all theme modifications in the `c-variables` SASS file. `c-variables` is not part of SASS. Change any variable and remove the `!default` exclamation to override Bootstrap defaults.
