Interest in town centre. There is a lot of boredom, inactivity and homelessness here, it seems. Office interiors and church yards. Fast food restaurants. Who is in the town? The odd salesperson, estate agent, office worker, beggars, market stalls, mums, dads; most people in baggy, gray joggers. If you look up the roofs are Victorian.
