title: 1917 Russia

[Who are you in 1917 Russia?](http://arzamas.academy/materials/1269) Anarchist. Strongly disagree with political parties: direct democracy. Socialism is the goal. Disassemble overseas colonies, end the war unconditionally. Private property not a natural right. Nationalise everything and put the workers in control. You know the routine.
