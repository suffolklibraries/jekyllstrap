title: Revolutionary romanticism

Not ungulity of <q><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/rojava-ypg-bob-crowe-volunteers-left-politics/">revolutionary romanticism</a></q> (also see: supporting St Pauli in your 40s), but who could blame a Scot with no job, money, pension or hope? Why not join a comradely war in Syria? There is something heroic in this, but it's not Madrid, 1936. There is no Labour Party and the rest of the left reenacts the old rituals, but the magic doesn't work: marches, banners and speeches. There is no Movement nor momentum. There is only despair and pessimism, fascism everyhwere, all of which could slide into an impotent nostalgia, mysticism or calls for stronger leaders of the left.
